# pass-it-around (Express.js Framework)

In this project I created a server-side application using the Express.js freamework. 

The server has three main pages, one 404 page, and dynamic pages 

1. Home Page - localhost:3000
1. Bottels page - localhost:3000/bottles
    - has dynamic link with positive numbers, i.e. localhost:3000/bottles/22
    - has a-tag link to the next dynamic page, localhost:3000/bottles/21
    - has a-tag link to home page
2. Bugs page - localhost:3000/bugs
    - has dynamic link with positive numbers, i.e. localhost:3000/bottles/22
    - has a tag link to the next dynamic page
    - has a-tag link to home page
3. 404 page - any other page that does not match the paths defined in the server
    - has a-tag link to home page
